The provided code is a React component called BreakdownChart. It
renders a pie chart 

using the ResponsivePie component from the @nivo/pie library. The chart displays
the breakdown of sales data by category.

Here's an overview of the component's implementation:
The component imports necessary dependencies from React, Material-UI 
(Box, Typography, useTheme),
and the API hook (useGetSalesQuery) for fetching sales data.

The BreakdownChart component takes an optional prop isDashboard, which determines
 the size and positioning of the chart. By default, isDashboard is set to false.

The useGetSalesQuery hook is used to fetch the sales data, and the result is 
destructured into data and isLoading variables. If the data is not available 
or still loading, the component returns the string "Loading..." as the content.

An array of colors is defined based on the theme palette from useTheme.

The formattedData variable is created by iterating over the salesByCategory
object in the data and mapping it to an array of objects with the required
structure for the pie chart. Each object represents a category and 
contains properties like id (category name), label (category name),
value (sales value), and color (assigned from the color array).

Inside the JSX, a Box component is used as the container for the
chart. The size and positioning of the Box are determined based on the 
isDashboard prop.

The ResponsivePie component is rendered inside the Box and receives
several props. It uses the formattedData as the data prop and 
defines a theme for styling.

Additional props are provided to customize the appearance of 
the pie chart, such as margin, innerRadius, borderWidth, borderColor, and more.

The legends prop configures the legend for the chart. It is positioned at the 
bottom and styled accordingly. Hover effects are also defined to highlight 
the legend item on hover.

Finally, a Box component is positioned absolutely to display the total sales 
amount. Its content is based on the isDashboard prop and the yearlySalesTotal 
value from the data.

In summary, the BreakdownChart component fetches sales data, formats it, 
and renders a responsive pie chart using the ResponsivePie component. The chart 
displays the breakdown of sales by category, with additional information 
such as legends and the total sales amount.
