The code provided is a React functional component that represents a sidebar. It 
uses Material-UI components to create the sidebar layout. Let's go through the code step by step:

The code defines a functional component named Sidebar that returns a JSX
 (JavaScript XML) structure.

The JSX structure is wrapped inside a <Box> component from Material-UI,
which represents a container element.

Inside the <Box> component, there is a conditional rendering using the logical AND (&&) operator. It checks the value of the isSideBarOpen variable and only renders the <Drawer> component if it is true.
The <Drawer> component represents the sidebar itself. It receives several props:
open prop: It determines whether the drawer is open or not based on the value of isSideBarOpen.
onClose prop: It specifies the function to be called when the user closes the drawer. In this case, it calls the setisSideBarOpen(false) function.
variant prop: It sets the variant of the drawer to "persistent", which means it remains open until explicitly closed.
anchor prop: It specifies the position of the drawer, which is set to "left" in this case.
sx prop: It allows customizing the styling of the drawer using the Material-UI's styling system.
Inside the <Drawer> component, there is a <Box> component that represents the sticky header of the sidebar.
The sticky header contains a <Box> component for the title of the sidebar and an <IconButton> component for the close button (displayed only on non-mobile devices).
The title is wrapped inside a <Typography> component with the variant set to "h4" and a fontWeight of "bold".
The close button is represented by an <IconButton> component, which triggers the setisSideBarOpen(!isSideBarOpen) function when clicked. It toggles the value of isSideBarOpen.
The closing tag of the <FlexBetween> component seems to be missing, assuming it's a custom component that provides a flex container with content distributed evenly between the items.
After the header, there is a <Divider> component to separate the header from the content of the sidebar.
The component ends with the closing tags for the <Box>, <Drawer>, and <Box> components.
Overall, this code creates a responsive sidebar with a sticky header, a title, and a close button. The sidebar itself is only rendered if the isSideBarOpen variable is true
