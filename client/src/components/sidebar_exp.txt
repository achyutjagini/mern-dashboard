The code provided is a React functional component that represents a sidebar. It 
uses Material-UI components to create the sidebar layout. Let's go 
through the code step by step:

The code defines a functional component named Sidebar that returns a JSX
(JavaScript XML) structure.

The JSX structure is wrapped inside a <Box> component from Material-UI,
which represents a container element.

Inside the <Box> component, there is a conditional rendering using the logical AND (&&) operator. 
It checks the value of the isSideBarOpen variable and only renders the <Drawer> component if it is true.

The <Drawer> component represents the sidebar itself. It receives several props:
open prop: It determines whether the drawer is open or not based on the value of isSideBarOpen.

onClose prop: It specifies the function to be called when the user closes the drawer. In 
this case, it calls the setisSideBarOpen(false) function.

variant prop: It sets the variant of the drawer to "persistent", which
means it remains open until explicitly closed.

anchor prop: It specifies the position of the drawer, which
is set to "left" in this case.

sx prop: It allows customizing the styling of the drawer
using the Material-UI's styling system.

The code you provided is using the sx prop in a React component to define 
the styles for a drawer component. Let's break down the styles being applied:

width: drawerWidth: Sets the width of the drawer 
component to a value specified by the drawerWidth variable.

"& .MuiDrawer-paper": Targets the child element with 
the class name .MuiDrawer-paper inside the drawer component.

color: theme.palette.secondary[200]: Sets the text
color of the .MuiDrawer-paper element to the value of the secondary[200] property in the theme's palette.

backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.alt: Sets the background 
color of the .MuiDrawer-paper element to the value of the background.alt property in the theme's palette.

boxSizing: "border-box": Sets the box-sizing property of the .MuiDrawer-paper element 
to "border-box", which includes borders and padding in the element's total width and height.

borderWidth: isNonMobile ? 0 : "2px": Sets the border width of the .MuiDrawer-paper
element to 0 if isNonMobile evaluates to true; otherwise, it sets it to "2px".

width: drawerWidth: Sets the width of the .MuiDrawer-paper element 
to the value of the drawerWidth variable.


<Box sx={{ position: 'sticky', top: '0', backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.alt, zIndex: '999' }}>

position: 'sticky': Sets the position of the element to "sticky". This means that the
 element will be positioned relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor or the viewport if no scrolling ancestor is found.

top: '0': Sets the distance between the top edge of the element and the top edge of
its scrolling ancestor or the viewport to 0. This ensures that the element 
will stick to the top of its container or the viewport.

backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.alt: Sets the background color of the element to the value
of the background.alt property in the theme's palette.

zIndex: '999': Sets the stack order of the element. It sets the z-index CSS
property to 999, which means the element will appear above elements with lower z-index values.

Overall, this code is styling a <Box> component to create a sticky element
 that sticks to the top of its container or the viewport. It has a custom background 
color and a high z-index value to ensure it appears above other elements on the page

Inside the <Drawer> component, there is a <Box> component
that represents the sticky header of the sidebar.

The sticky header contains a <Box> component for the 
title of the sidebar and an <IconButton> component for 
the close button (displayed only on non-mobile devices).

The title is wrapped inside a <Typography> component 
with the variant set to "h4" and a fontWeight of "bold".

The close button is represented by an <IconButton> component,
 which triggers the setisSideBarOpen(!isSideBarOpen) function
  when clicked. It toggles the value of isSideBarOpen.

The closing tag of the <FlexBetween> component seems to be missing, assuming 
it's a custom component that provides a flex container with content
 distributed evenly between the items.

After the header, there is a <Divider> component to separate the 
header from the content of the sidebar.

The component ends with the closing tags for the <Box>, <Drawer>, and <Box> components.
Overall, this code creates a responsive sidebar with a sticky 
header, a title, and a close button. The sidebar itself is 
only rendered if the isSideBarOpen variable is true
