The code you provided shows the usage of the createApi function from 
the @reduxjs/toolkit/query/react package to create an API instance with
 multiple endpoints. It also exports several hooks for each endpoint to be used in
  React components. Let's break down the code:


import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";

export const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL }),
  reducerPath: "adminApi",
  tagTypes: [
    "User",
    "Products",
    "Customers",
    "Transactions",
    "Geography",
    "Sales",
    "Admins",
    "Performance",
    "Dashboard",
  ],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    // ... endpoint definitions
  }),
});

export const {
  useGetUserQuery,
  useGetProductsQuery,
  useGetCustomersQuery,
  useGetTransactionsQuery,
  useGetGeographyQuery,
  useGetSalesQuery,
  useGetAdminsQuery,
  useGetUserPerformanceQuery,
  useGetDashboardQuery,
} = api;

The code imports the createApi and fetchBaseQuery functions 
from the @reduxjs/toolkit/query/react package.

It then uses the createApi function to create an API instance. 
The createApi function accepts an options object with various properties:

baseQuery is set to fetchBaseQuery with an object that contains 
the baseUrl property. The baseUrl value is retrieved from the
 REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable, which should be defined
  in your environment configuration.

reducerPath is set to "adminApi", specifying the key under
 which the API state will be stored in the Redux store.

tagTypes is an array that defines different tags for the API
 endpoints. These tags can be used for invalidation and caching purposes.

endpoints is a function that receives a build object used to
define the API endpoints. Each endpoint is defined using the
build.query() method, specifying the query configuration, 
such as the query function and the tags it provides.

The created API instance is exported as api, which can be 
used to interact with the API endpoints.

The code also exports several hooks generated by the api instance, 
such as useGetUserQuery, useGetProductsQuery, and others. These hooks 
can be used in React components to make queries to the corresponding 
endpoints defined in the endpoints object.

Make sure to import and use these exported hooks in your React 
components to utilize the defined API endpoints and retrieve 
the data from the server.
