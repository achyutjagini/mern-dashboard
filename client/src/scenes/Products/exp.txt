In the code snippet you provided, it appears to be a JSX code using a
 combination of the Box component and various props to style a grid layout.
  Let's break down the props used:

mt="20px": This sets a top margin of 20px for the Box component, creating vertical space above it.

display="grid": This specifies that the Box component 
should be displayed as a grid container.

gridTemplateColumns="repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))": This defines the
 template for the grid columns. It sets the columns to repeat 4
  times (repeat(4, ...)), and each column should have a minimum 
  width of 0 (minmax(0, ...)) and expand to fill the available space equally (1fr).

justifyContent="space-between": This aligns the grid items 
along the horizontal axis and specifies that the extra space 
between the columns should be distributed evenly, creating 
equal space between each column.

rowGap="20px": This sets a vertical gap or spacing of 20px between the rows of the grid.

columnGap="1.33%": This sets a horizontal gap or spacing between the columns of the grid. The value 1.33% represents a percentage-based gap relative to the width of the grid columns.

sx: This prop is typically used in UI frameworks or
 libraries that support custom styling. It allows you to provide custom CSS-in-JS styles to the component.
  In this case, the provided style object targets direct child div elements of the Box component
   and sets the gridColumn property to "span 4" if the isNonMobile variable is truthy. T
   his means that each child div will span 4 columns in the grid on non-mobile devices,
    but the specific value of isNonMobile is not clear in the code snippet you provided.

Please note that the isNonMobile variable is not defined in the code snippet, so its value and behavior are unknown.
