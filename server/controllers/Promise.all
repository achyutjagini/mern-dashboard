Promise.all is a method in JavaScript that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise. 
This method is typically used when you want to execute multiple asynchronous operations
 concurrently and wait for all of them to complete.

Here's how Promise.all works:

It takes an array of promises as an argument.
It returns a new promise that fulfills when all the promises in the input array have been fulfilled, 
or rejects if any of the promises in the input array reject.

The fulfilled value of the returned promise is an array of the resolved values of the input
promises, in the same order as the input array.

In the context of the code you provided, Promise.all is used to handle multiple asynchronous
operations inside the map function. Each iteration of the map function creates a promise
by calling ProductStat.find() to retrieve statistics for a particular product.

By using Promise.all with await, the code waits for all those promises to resolve 
before proceeding to the next step. This ensures that all the statistics for 
each product are retrieved before sending the response.

Once all the promises are resolved, the Promise.all call returns a new promise
 that is assigned to the variable productsWithStats. This promise resolves to 
 an array of objects, where each object represents a product
  with its associated statistics.

In summary, Promise.all is used to wait for multiple promises to resolve concurrently, and it provides a way to handle multiple asynchronous operations efficiently and obtain their combined results.
