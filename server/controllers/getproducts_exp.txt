export const getProducts = async (req, res) => {
try {
    const products = await Product.find();
    

This code defines an asynchronous function named getProducts that takes two parameters:
req (request) and res (response). It is likely a part of a web server framework or API 
endpoint. The function attempts to retrieve products using Product.find(), 
an asynchronous operation that returns a list of products.



        const productsWithStats = await Promise.all(
            products.map(async (product) => {
                const stat = await ProductStat.find({
                    productId: product._id,
                });
                return {
                    ...product._doc,
                    stat,
                };
            })
        );
Here, Promise.all() is used to wait for multiple promises to resolve. The map() function is
 called on the products array, creating a new array where each product is 
 transformed with additional statistics.

For each product, it calls ProductStat.find() to find the corresponding statistics for
 that product. The productId field of ProductStat is matched with the _id field of the 
 current product. This is likely a way to associate product statistics with the product itself.

The spread operator (...) is used in { ...product._doc, stat } to create a new object.
 The spread operator copies all the properties of product._doc (excluding the _id) and 
 adds the stat property to it. This way, each transformed product object will have the
 original product properties along with the associated statistics.



        res.status(200).json(productsWithStats);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(404).json({ message: error.message });
    }
};
Finally, if the code executes without any errors, it sends a JSON response with
 a status code of 200 (OK) and the productsWithStats array as the response body.
  If an error occurs, it sends a JSON response with a status code of 404 
(Not Found) and an error message in the response body.

Now, let's explain the spread operator (...):

The spread operator is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that allows an iterable (like an array or object) to be expanded into individual elements or properties. In the code snippet above, the spread operator is used within an object literal ({ ...product._doc, stat }) to create a new object by spreading the properties of product._doc.

For example, if product._doc is { name: 'Product 1', price: 10 }, using the spread operator like { ...product._doc, stat } would create a new object with the same properties (name and price) as product._doc. So the resulting object would be { name: 'Product 1', price: 10, stat: ... }. It effectively merges the properties of product._doc with the additional stat property.

In summary, the code fetches a list of products and then fetches associated statistics for each product. It transforms each product object by merging the original product properties with the associated statistics using the spread operator. Finally, it sends the transformed products with statistics as the response.
