The getCustomers function is declared as an asynchronous function, 
indicating that it may perform asynchronous operations.

Within the function body, there is a try-catch block, which is
used to handle any errors that may occur during
the execution of the code.

Inside the try block:

The User.find({ role: "user" }) function is called, presumably 
to retrieve a list of customers from a database. It uses the 
find method provided by the User model or database schema.
The { role: "user" } object is used as a query to filter
the users with the role "user".

The select("-password") method is used to exclude the "password" field 
from the retrieved user objects. This is commonly done for security reasons,
 as passwords should not be exposed in the response.

The result of the query is stored in the customers variable. 
It seems to be an array of user objects.
After retrieving the customers, the code sends an HTTP response 
with a status code of 200 (indicating a successful request) and 
JSON data representing the customers array. The res.status(200).json(customers) 
statement is responsible for sending the response.

If an error occurs during the execution of the try block, the catch 
block is executed. It sends an HTTP response with a status code of
404 (indicating a "Not Found" error) and a
JSON object containing an error message.
