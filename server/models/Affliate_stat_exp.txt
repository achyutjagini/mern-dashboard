const AffiliateStatSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ ... });: This section defines the Mongoose 
schema for the "AffiliateStat" collection. The schema specifies the structure of the 
documents in the collection. It consists of two fields:

userId: This field represents the user associated with the affiliate stats. It is 
of type mongoose.Types.ObjectId and references the "User" collection. It means that
the "userId" field in each "AffiliateStat" document will store an ObjectId that
corresponds to a document in the "User" collection.


affiliateSales: This field represents the affiliate sales associated with the user.
It is an array of mongoose.Types.ObjectId and references the "Transaction" collection.
It means that the "affiliateSales" field in each "AffiliateStat" document will store
an array of ObjectIds, where each ObjectId corresponds to a document
in the "Transaction" collection.


{ timestamps: true }: This option in the schema adds two additional fields 
to each document: "createdAt" and "updatedAt". These fields will automatically 
be managed by Mongoose and represent the creation and last update times of each document.


const AffiliateStat = mongoose.model("AffiliateStat", AffiliateStatSchema);:
This line creates the Mongoose model for the "AffiliateStat" collection. The 
model is used to interact with the collection in the database. It takes
two arguments: the name of the model ("AffiliateStat") and the schema
(AffiliateStatSchema) that defines the structure of the documents.
